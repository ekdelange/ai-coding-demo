# Tariff Impact Dashboard

This Dash application visualises the landed-cost impact of US import tariffs on the AX100 and AX200 actuator families. It reads the `JE_Tariff_Shock_Demo_v2.xlsx` workbook to compute material, logistics, conversion and tariff costs across different assembly scenarios.

## How to run

1. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch the dashboard:

   ```bash

   ```

4. Open the displayed local URL in a browser to interact with the dashboard.
